'''
DataFrame.ix
A primarily label-location based indexer, with integer position fallback.

.ix[] supports mixed integer and label based access. It is primarily label based, but will fall back to integer positional access unless the corresponding axis is of integer type.

.ix is the most general indexer and will support any of the inputs in .loc and .iloc. .ix also supports floating point label schemes. .ix is exceptionally useful when dealing with mixed positional and label based hierachical indexes.

However, when an axis is integer based, ONLY label based access and not positional access is supported. Thus, in such cases, itâ€™s usually better to be explicit and use .iloc or .loc.

pivot 

Explort table with one or more group

NOTE: in book, it use 'rows' instead of 'index', but in new pandas version, 'rows' is not supported
